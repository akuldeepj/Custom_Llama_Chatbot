# Chatbot with LangChain

This project demonstrates how to create a chatbot using LangChain. The chatbot is capable of loading and processing documents from a PDF file, creating a FAISS database for efficient retrieval, and interacting with users using an LLM (Large Language Model). The chatbot can handle greetings, goodbyes, and small talk, and answer questions based on the provided context from the PDF.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `langchain_community`
- `langchain_core`
- `langchain_chains`
- `PyPDFLoader`
- `FAISS`
- `OllamaEmbeddings`
- `Ollama`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/chatbot-with-langchain.git
   cd chatbot-with-langchain
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```sh
   pip install langchain_community langchain_core langchain_chains PyPDFLoader FAISS Ollama
   ```

## Usage

1. Place the PDF file you want to use in the project directory. For this example, the file should be named `Chatbot.pdf`.

2. Run the chatbot script:

   ```sh
   python chatbot.py
   ```

3. Interact with the chatbot through the command line. Type your questions and the chatbot will provide answers based on the content of the PDF. Type "bye" to exit the chat.
